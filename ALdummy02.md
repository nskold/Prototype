The Prototype adds some sense of order to a scoop of scores.

The Prototype repository is a read/write area for developers.
The initial developer is Arthur Lenskold (AL).
A goal is to have the Prototype repository with no sub-repositories,
and for the Prototype repository to have one parent repository, Team_d2scor.

The Prototype repository is an uncompressed limited database.
It is a sandbox of a few complete sets of unsequenced Gregorian
chant scores for various years, months, days, and hours at which
the corresponding Mass is celebrated.

---
The Prototype repository is intended for computer programmers wanting to
have a niche to develop either the Android or the iOS app named DayToScore.
The limited Prototype database helps to serve musically complete test cases.
Each test case for a particular Mass consists of about 5 musical scores  
that require to be put in the sequence as they might be chanted at a Mass.
